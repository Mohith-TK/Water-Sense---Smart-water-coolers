## Water-Sense---Smart-water-coolers

This web applicaion allows the smart water cooler service providers to monitor their products installed in various locations and
service them when necessary based on the data obtained through the sensors present in the coolers. The sensor data is sent using MQTT 
protocol in 1 hour intervals. The users who can access this website are controlled by the backend server which stores the logins and
passwords. Users can be added and removed only through the backend servers. 

This web application is made using Bootstrap, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and MQTT npm package.

The web application can be improved by doing cloud based analytics to diagnose the smart water cooler more accurate and quicker.
